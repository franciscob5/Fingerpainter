<h1>★ Finger Painter ★</h1>

<p>Finger Painter is an app where you can draw whatever you like using your finger, with customizable features such 
as line thickness, color variety, and changeable backgrounds.</p>

<p>From the start, you can use the default white screen to get creative. You can explore the tabs at the botton of
the first screen to change color of the pen and also make your own custom background by downloading a picture from 
your camera roll. </p>

<p style="text-align:center"><em>Enjoy!</em></p>

<h1> Troubleshooting </h1>

<p>If your custom color is not showing up, make sure you have selected the custom color option on the bottom of the color selection wheel.</p>
